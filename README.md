MYND
==========
MYND is a Swift app with a minimalistic interface that allows users to do a quick personal mental health
check in by logging how their day went in less than 1 minute. After filling out the short form
in the "today" tab, users will see a new log saved in the "archive" tab, along with all the previous 
logs. Some people (ex: high schoolers like me!) may have lots going on during the day and no time 
to keep track of or reflect on how they are doing mentally. With MYND, they can do exactly this in
virtually no time at all!
